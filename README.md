# Form Validation

Designed by F8 (Original).

I learned how to code a form at F8 youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdvRm1bfGAk). Then I decided to code a form myslef. Form bases on what I learned from the video but with MVC structure.

This code is reusable (atleast for me:v) - I will use this as my own library.

# The purpose of file "script.js"

File 'script.js' handles information in form.

# What I learned with this pet-project?

- Get used to the MVC structure.
- Understand Debounce function in JavaScript (it seems like Decorator in Python).
- How to handle form inputs, form submit event.
- Use ES6, Class, Import, Export,...

# Time to code
